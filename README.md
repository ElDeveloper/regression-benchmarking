# regression-benchmarking

Source code for the generation of the benchmarking results. `bench_general.py`
is the script we used to submit multiple iterations of each parameter and model
combination. `figure-generation.ipynb` uses the data generated by
`bench_general.py` and produces the manuscript's figures.
